2021-11-09 22:18:38	codeforf00d	i do remember reading rainbow though!!
2021-11-09 22:18:50	jalopyjones	and whats a book?
2021-11-09 22:18:54	codeforf00d	holy shit flashback to my childhood
2021-11-09 22:19:06	10x_programmer	isn't C99 pretty outdated? There is already C17
2021-11-09 22:19:24	osgmr	youtube nostalgia hits are like digital LSD with the flashback triggers

2021-11-09 22:22:11	codeforf00d	music on but down around 30-40%
2021-11-09 22:22:37	codeforf00d	right now its great
2021-11-09 22:23:00	jalopyjones	right, so strange... might need a graphical interface that shows you where the audio is.. and then you could like have slider bars to where its decent and louder and then quiet and then just ignore all of it and move the volumes wherever whenever...
2021-11-09 22:23:03	porschephilth	we have a "pre-defined" dockerfile in the repo, the devs can't change params, they can only add the bits they need
2021-11-09 22:23:46	porschephilth	yes, then we jam things through our tool that builds a custom helm chart
2021-11-09 22:24:07	porschephilth	we do
2021-11-09 22:24:10	lousenti	@10x_programmer, the switch from C89 to C11 in the linux kernel is currently ongoing and as far as I have heard is a big deal => https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.15-Raising-GCC
2021-11-09 22:24:47	porschephilth	then deploy process runs helm to deploy to the cluster
2021-11-09 22:25:51	codeforf00d	are helm charts basically instructions for a how an app is built/ran?
2021-11-09 22:25:58	porschephilth	i won't touch any of that because we're not prepared to take that on right now
2021-11-09 22:25:59	codeforf00d	for generalized purpose?
2021-11-09 22:26:09	codeforf00d	sorry if thats a loaded question
2021-11-09 22:26:22	codeforf00d	ah ok thanks!
2021-11-09 22:26:54	10x_programmer	@lousenti the Linux kernel is a nightmare anyway regarding the standard, a lot of GCC specific code, like all the non-standard structure initialization
2021-11-09 22:27:33	codeforf00d	yeah that sounds great rob, i love to learn
2021-11-09 22:28:23	codeforf00d	i think a template that requires you to delete pieces isnt a very good template, maybe thats just my opinion
2021-11-09 22:28:33	codeforf00d	i know a template is generalized but ehh
2021-11-09 22:28:45	jalopyjones	yea but if they have to use the template, the template needs to be able to return null if a thing isnt being used...
2021-11-09 22:29:08	codeforf00d	ohh ok thanks, this is all new info for me
2021-11-09 22:29:33	codeforf00d	never used any of these tools but its interesting
2021-11-09 22:30:28	jalopyjones	"just chatting - im doin shit" all the bases covered
2021-11-09 22:32:33	jalopyjones	you need a name, for this? well you arent bulding anything either... so this is just a call script?
2021-11-09 22:34:12	codeforf00d	i think app sounds good, its fast and quick and pretty generic
2021-11-09 22:34:15	jalopyjones	your nightmare im just along for the ride
2021-11-09 22:34:19	codeforf00d	kapp yeah sure
2021-11-09 22:34:59	jalopyjones	i think it should be kappa
2021-11-09 22:35:03	jalopyjones	Kappa
2021-11-09 22:35:18	jalopyjones	complete mock
2021-11-09 22:35:22	porschephilth	i'm trying to think wht my equiv is for those items
2021-11-09 22:35:24	jalopyjones	do it
2021-11-09 22:35:33	codeforf00d	cmonBruh
2021-11-09 22:36:04	codeforf00d	i think kapp is perfect
2021-11-09 22:36:09	codeforf00d	best thing next to app
2021-11-09 22:36:13	porschephilth	validate - we use SonarQube for code quality
2021-11-09 22:36:24	codeforf00d	yup absolutely
2021-11-09 22:36:28	porschephilth	install - we use Helm
2021-11-09 22:36:45	lousenti	some other ideas: "setup" or "package" (too generic?) or "deployment" (a bit long?).
2021-11-09 22:37:20	codeforf00d	every readme should REQUIRE install instructions idc how obvious
2021-11-09 22:37:34	codeforf00d	absolutely rediculous when github repos just assume
2021-11-09 22:38:18	jalopyjones	what?
2021-11-09 22:38:20	codeforf00d	WOW
2021-11-09 22:38:25	porschephilth	ah, we are not allowed to let the devs have any rights related to deploying anything, separation of duty for auditing reqs
2021-11-09 22:38:34	codeforf00d	great engineer != good manager lol
2021-11-09 22:38:43	jalopyjones	you dont have a centralized compelation of things, or was it his personal shit?
2021-11-09 22:39:59	jalopyjones	fork of a fork, so fork everyones shit and make a business repo... for just work stuff...
2021-11-09 22:40:03	codeforf00d	yeah absolutely rob; it can be frustrating but at the same time you dont want to damage relationships. its a weird emotion dance you have to do
2021-11-09 22:40:04	lousenti	A little late, but "Standards" => https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png :p
2021-11-09 22:41:09	porschephilth	how can you not like Manjaro?" haha
2021-11-09 22:41:41	codeforf00d	amazing comic LOL
2021-11-09 22:41:45	codeforf00d	describes work so well

2021-11-09 23:37:58	proportionate1	solution: gitops
2021-11-09 23:38:04	proportionate1	no one gets creds
2021-11-09 23:38:19	taniwha3	yep, i don't want anyone having access to prod
2021-11-09 23:39:28	bleedfuel	whaaat?/
2021-11-09 23:39:30	taniwha3	gitops requires what?
2021-11-09 23:39:46	taniwha3	oh that's not true but it helps
2021-11-09 23:40:00	taniwha3	google is a monolith repo
2021-11-09 23:40:05	taniwha3	but they don't use git
2021-11-09 23:40:27	taniwha3	git's architecture requires us to move towards lots of little repos
2021-11-09 23:40:30	taniwha3	which isn't a bad thing
2021-11-09 23:41:11	taniwha3	you sure about that? ;)
2021-11-09 23:41:26	proportionate1	I spent last week teaching git basics
2021-11-09 23:41:58	bleedfuel	master as dev? why
2021-11-09 23:42:28	bleedfuel	master is prod
2021-11-09 23:42:37	taniwha3	also use main instead of master, inclusive naming :)
2021-11-09 23:43:06	lasting_	excuse me, but using "master" is offensive. I'm very offended.
2021-11-09 23:43:10	taniwha3	m<tab> and never start branches starting with m
2021-11-09 23:43:21	codeforf00d	im offended at you being offended!
2021-11-09 23:43:32	lasting_	kidding, kidding
2021-11-09 23:43:34	bleedfuel	we have branch tests off of main. but then once code passes then it goes to "Main"
2021-11-09 23:44:16	bleedfuel	why do you not like it
2021-11-09 23:44:52	taniwha3	i always push for a new branch for every PR, and always squash merge into main
2021-11-09 23:44:54	bleedfuel	i have not anyone has told me this. that is why i am wondering
2021-11-09 23:45:11	taniwha3	specifically squash/merge, not rebase/merge
2021-11-09 23:45:30	bleedfuel	noooo all PR /mr is to main
2021-11-09 23:45:50	proportionate1	I force squashes on merge
2021-11-09 23:45:54	taniwha3	CI/CD squashes, you don't get a choice ;)
2021-11-09 23:45:56	taniwha3	enforced
2021-11-09 23:46:07	proportionate1	You can force it as a CODEOWNER
2021-11-09 23:46:40	taniwha3	i need to ressurect the pulls command from github.com/docker/gordon
2021-11-09 23:46:47	proportionate1	This is one reason I liked Gerrit...you have no choice but to squash
2021-11-09 23:47:14	bleedfuel	i dont like sqashing. i like to see every commit
2021-11-09 23:47:41	taniwha3	why do you want to see all my intermediate commits from my dev work?
2021-11-09 23:47:44	taniwha3	that's noise you don't need
2021-11-09 23:47:57	proportionate1	@bleedfuel it depends...I have folks who commit "Fixed it" or "typo"
2021-11-09 23:48:13	bleedfuel	ya so why do you not want to show it?
2021-11-09 23:48:28	taniwha3	you want my completed feature, not all the tiny intermediate commits/snapshots
2021-11-09 23:48:36	taniwha3	and i don't want all your intermediate steps :p
2021-11-09 23:48:47	taniwha3	exactly, that's why we squash on PR
2021-11-09 23:48:52	proportionate1	A commit that reads "Fixed it" says nothing about the change.
2021-11-09 23:49:14	bleedfuel	you want commits so you can go back if someone f*** up and breakes the whole system
2021-11-09 23:49:28	taniwha3	they don't, because you keep features small
2021-11-09 23:49:41	bleedfuel	nooo
2021-11-09 23:49:44	taniwha3	large commits you reject
2021-11-09 23:49:50	taniwha3	tell the author to send smaller commits
2021-11-09 23:49:54	proportionate1	@bleedfuel I get the same capability with a squash
2021-11-09 23:50:16	bleedfuel	then you still have a "big" commit
2021-11-09 23:50:43	taniwha3	so if i make a small change, then add a test, then fix a typo... then submit a PR... then CI/CD squashes. no problem ;)
2021-11-09 23:50:48	proportionate1	Github UI lets you squash
2021-11-09 23:50:48	taniwha3	you don't need to know how to squash
2021-11-09 23:50:55	taniwha3	CI/CD does it
2021-11-09 23:51:13	taniwha3	then you can't have gitops
2021-11-09 23:51:19	taniwha3	ci/cd is crucial to gitops
2021-11-09 23:51:35	bleedfuel	so that is not a problem with how you commit code. you are scared of the ci/di pipline
2021-11-09 23:51:37	proportionate1	well...no
2021-11-09 23:51:42	taniwha3	ci/cd doesn't negate good PR reviews
2021-11-09 23:52:08	proportionate1	solarwinds
2021-11-09 23:52:11	taniwha3	that isn't an issue with ci/cd, that's an issue with the human processes
2021-11-09 23:52:22	taniwha3	ci/cd is a control but doesn't solve all problems
2021-11-09 23:52:31	proportionate1	@taniwha3 agreed
2021-11-09 23:52:58	taniwha3	yea, you need humans involved... but automate the processes between humans
2021-11-09 23:53:16	proportionate1	you know how you solve this? immutable (and enforced) artifacts
2021-11-09 23:53:46	bleedfuel	I just implemeted the new ci/cd and its flawed in many ways
2021-11-09 23:53:50	taniwha3	e.g. i send a patch, why should you check if it compiles? ci/cd can check that automatically. only pull you in when a minimum set of quality gates are met, then it's you're responsibility as a repo owner to ensure what gets merged in is high quality and properly reviewed
2021-11-09 23:54:19	bleedfuel	no you should check if you crap compiles
2021-11-09 23:54:30	taniwha3	the humans break down in all cases :p
2021-11-09 23:54:32	bleedfuel	that makes no sence
2021-11-09 23:54:39	proportionate1	@bleedfuel worked on my laptop!
2021-11-09 23:54:56	taniwha3	ugh, that's terrible
2021-11-09 23:55:05	bleedfuel	test you own code @proportionate1 wtf. it should works before you commit
2021-11-09 23:55:10	taniwha3	i used to be the "build cop" and I was harsh on my engineers :p
2021-11-09 23:55:20	taniwha3	i had a team that reviewed all that stuff in detail
2021-11-09 23:55:42	proportionate1	I do test before I commit...but that doesnt mean that anyone else should just trust my word
2021-11-09 23:56:03	taniwha3	lol
2021-11-09 23:56:07	taniwha3	please do
2021-11-09 23:56:18	taniwha3	and then i met the president... again
2021-11-09 23:56:25	bleedfuel	build cop, how you doing this then
2021-11-09 23:56:45	bleedfuel	build cop RON
2021-11-09 23:57:04	taniwha3	@bleedfuel lots and lots of automated integration tests that took control of the mouse and keyboard at the kernel level and ran a massive battery of tests on hundreds of systems simultaneously
2021-11-09 23:57:34	proportionate1	Oh jesus hadoop
2021-11-09 23:57:36	bleedfuel	Ok what does that point out
2021-11-09 23:57:52	taniwha3	that important workflows don't break
2021-11-09 23:58:01	taniwha3	not just unit tests, but integration tests
2021-11-09 23:58:02	bleedfuel	ya pull crap
2021-11-09 23:58:52	taniwha3	BDD gets devs to think of what the user is going to do, serves a good purpose
2021-11-09 23:59:07	bleedfuel	yes that is fine
2021-11-09 23:59:30	taniwha3	i worry about how much BDD scales in the long run, but it works in a lot of cases
2021-11-09 23:59:47	taniwha3	eventually you need someone or a team to own the user's experience on the largest projects
2021-11-10 00:00:02	taniwha3	devs don't do UX well, and that's a full time job
2021-11-10 00:00:05	proportionate1	I have a crazier idea
2021-11-10 00:00:16	taniwha3	let's hear it @proportionate1
2021-11-10 00:00:17	proportionate1	how about TALKING to a customer?
2021-11-10 00:00:21	bleedfuel	i kinda agree. you need to get the workflow of what is needed
2021-11-10 00:00:23	taniwha3	oh couldn't possibly do that :p
2021-11-10 00:00:35	taniwha3	i love talking with customers
2021-11-10 00:00:59	bleedfuel	the other thing is you need to sell what you implemented.
2021-11-10 00:01:02	taniwha3	listen to what customer pain points are carefully, then find a way to solve it more holistically than how they are thinking
2021-11-10 00:02:39	taniwha3	what problem does k8s solve that google engineers had? ;)
2021-11-10 00:03:34	basedpath	One of my biggest gripes at my current job is that sometimes it's hard to get documentation for internal services that you need to integrate to. Sometimes your customer/client is other devs, make documentation!
2021-11-10 00:04:57	proportionate1	Lots of operators gripe about k8s being complicated...yet have never used it.
2021-11-10 00:05:36	basedpath	Sure, but these services are sometimes massive. Reading the code is sometimes a huge task on it's own. One of our monoliths is over 6 million lines. Determining side effects is really hard.
2021-11-10 00:05:57	lousenti	On a side note and a little late, but I think the workflow you mentioned earlier is called "trunk based development" => https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development && https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-trunk-based-development
2021-11-10 00:06:05	taniwha3	@proportionate1 i've found that to be true, they hear war stories from other people who supposedly ran it
2021-11-10 00:06:16	taniwha3	i mean, there is real complexity there, but not where they often think
2021-11-10 00:06:49	proportionate1	@taniwha3 they just want their shit-ass Chef recipes with their cushy job
2021-11-10 00:08:01	proportionate1	honest question (because I see this a lot too)...how did your team land on k8s if they perhaps dont have the skills?
2021-11-10 00:09:04	proportionate1	I mean who made the decision for k8s?
2021-11-10 00:09:08	basedpath	I've had mixed experience with ops/product support people. I've known some that do the bare minimum and some that have their own runbooks, support script repos and know the product almost as well as some of the senior devs.
2021-11-10 00:09:15	proportionate1	to pick
2021-11-10 00:09:39	bleedfuel	nooo windows
2021-11-10 00:09:39	proportionate1	No linux in banks
2021-11-10 00:09:47	proportionate1	Kerberos everywhere
2021-11-10 00:10:17	proportionate1	When I was contracted there it was PuTTY over VDI
2021-11-10 00:10:19	aethuall	Docker desktop makes me throw up in my mouth
2021-11-10 00:10:24	taniwha3	wait, banks use synchronous encryption everywhere? ;)
2021-11-10 00:10:37	taniwha3	kerberos is synchronous encryption
2021-11-10 00:10:42	bleedfuel	at least use cygwin
2021-11-10 00:11:39	proportionate1	PuTTY is shit.
2021-11-10 00:11:52	proportionate1	middle click to paste...LUL
2021-11-10 00:12:20	aethuall	oh no
2021-11-10 00:12:36	codeforf00d	thats scary
2021-11-10 00:13:10	het_tanis	How goes the build?
2021-11-10 00:13:21	aethuall	when I was at university somebody changed the server's default tmux binding from ctrl-B to ctrl-A LUL
2021-11-10 00:13:30	het_tanis	I appreciate it.
2021-11-10 00:13:39	aethuall	(one of the grumpy sysadmins in the university IT department no doubt)
2021-11-10 00:13:52	het_tanis	Nice
2021-11-10 00:14:04	het_tanis	I'll watch, yeah.
2021-11-10 00:14:36	het_tanis	Shoot
2021-11-10 00:14:49	het_tanis	I have not, actually.
2021-11-10 00:14:54	het_tanis	I don't even use qq
2021-11-10 00:15:02	taniwha3	ctrl c or ctrl z?
2021-11-10 00:15:07	taniwha3	i misheard maybe
2021-11-10 00:15:11	het_tanis	I just use : w q
2021-11-10 00:15:19	het_tanis	yeah, I'm a nerd
2021-11-10 00:15:23	taniwha3	ctrl z, killall vim :D
2021-11-10 00:15:24	bleedfuel	:wq a;;l dau
2021-11-10 00:15:29	het_tanis	I don't know any other cool ways
2021-11-10 00:15:37	het_tanis	I only do what works for my simple brain. LOL
2021-11-10 00:15:49	het_tanis	ha
2021-11-10 00:15:50	aethuall	I just :wq
2021-11-10 00:17:14	taniwha3	the best way to quit vim is with timeout
2021-11-10 00:17:20	bleedfuel	yy<x numbers> is the best
2021-11-10 00:17:22	taniwha3	e.g. i want to use it for 5 minutes
2021-11-10 00:17:25	taniwha3	timeout 5m vim
2021-11-10 00:17:33	taniwha3	auto kills at 5m
2021-11-10 00:18:02	bleedfuel	timeout? really that is a thing
2021-11-10 00:18:10	aethuall	did I ever get you to look at my crappy attempt at learning go with a shell emulator?
2021-11-10 00:18:24	aethuall	https://github.com/jaydonhansen/gosh
2021-11-10 00:18:32	taniwha3	timeout is a thing
2021-11-10 00:19:20	lousenti	@proportionate1, don't know about the company rob is working at, but my best guess: Money and long term planning. Building up a k8s cluster on commodity hardware/server is probably way (!) cheaper, future proof (hardware/people) and flexible/scalable (eg with AWS) than doing all the HPC/CAE stuff on old legacy Cray, SGI and IBM hardware.
2021-11-10 00:20:11	aethuall	yeah my inexperience with Go shows in my code but it's my first hacky attempt at something
2021-11-10 00:20:17	aethuall	LUL
2021-11-10 00:21:37	taniwha3	he moonwalked off the set
2021-11-10 00:21:53	taniwha3	he was
2021-11-10 00:22:00	proportionate1	She was on Real Housewives of Orange County
2021-11-10 00:22:13	proportionate1	yep

2021-11-10 00:23:02	bleedfuel	lol
2021-11-10 00:23:20	taniwha3	i know someone who was on the first-ever music video shown on MTV :p
2021-11-10 00:23:24	taniwha3	song was video killed the radio star
2021-11-10 00:23:37	taniwha3	no, someone different
2021-11-10 00:23:49	taniwha3	i know the daughter of one of the dancers
2021-11-10 00:24:02	bleedfuel	yo you got her. just DM her
2021-11-10 00:24:26	bleedfuel	lol

2021-11-10 00:24:40	taniwha3	suspicious
2021-11-10 00:24:52	taniwha3	not at all :p
2021-11-10 00:25:28	het_tanis	Stacy's mom has got it going on.
2021-11-10 00:25:30	taniwha3	i don't understand why people care
2021-11-10 00:25:35	taniwha3	lol, stacy's mom
2021-11-10 00:26:05	het_tanis	Wait, your wife's name is Julie?

2021-11-10 00:26:11	het_tanis	Not kidding
2021-11-10 00:26:19	het_tanis	ha
2021-11-10 00:26:25	taniwha3	his wife is stacy's mom
2021-11-10 00:27:25	het_tanis	It's soft porn because you stay soft when you watch it....
2021-11-10 00:27:48	taniwha3	Adam Schlesinger who did stacy's mom song passed away
2021-11-10 00:27:56	taniwha3	coavid
2021-11-10 00:27:57	het_tanis	I have to turn in, in a bit too.
